All scripts for debiasing and downscaling the paleoclimatic simulations and IPCC AR5 simulations were developed by Dr. David Lorenz at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Data processing scripts are written in Fortran.  They are provided to enable reproducibility and transparency.  If you have questions, please contact Dr. Lorenz (david.lorenz@wisc.edu) or Dr. Jack Williams (jwwilliams1@wisc.edu) but please note that our time to provide technical support is quite limited.

R scripts to convert climate tables to bioclimatic rasters were written by Matt Lisk (mlisk@umces.edu) and Diego Nieto-Lugilde (dnietolugilde@gmail.com) at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science - Appalachian Lab.
